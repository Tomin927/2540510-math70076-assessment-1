Summarise the style guidelines:

In order to analize the CSR neuclear weapons systems dataset.  Some of the chart designs are useful such as the "Bar chart (Stacked)" and "Line chart (Stacked)". 

To illustrate the relationship between the number of Neuclear Warhead Inventories and the time for the P5 countries: USA, Russia, China, UK, and France,  the line chart (Stacked) style is appropriate. There are 3 benefits:

- It can show the total number of weapons systems in a year
- It can show the proportion of weapons systems held by a country in a year
- It can show the trend of the number of weapons systems over a period.


For guidelines of "Lines Stacked". The title name needs to be in "bold" type and relays to the main idea of the information of interest. The subtitle describes in details that the information extract from the dataset, and its font should be smaller than the title. The legend shows the name of data for different classes, the P5 countries. Each line stacks should be in different and appropriate colours. The order of stacking is also satisfied: countries with large number of weapons systems are at the bottom, and vise versa. 

Some critria are difficult to follow. For example, the red line at the top of the chart, the the background colour are hard to find.

An alternation is the Blob heads, which can show the type of weapons systems held by a country in a year, where the x_axis shows the time from 1945 to 2024, and the y-axis shows the type of weapons systems, which label by its starting year, held by different countries.
